# DGIN-ATIS: Advanced Speech Recognition for Athlete Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides the implementation of an advanced deep learning framework for **speech-based athlete performance analysis** in sports science. The framework integrates cutting-edge models—**Dynamic Game Intelligence Network (DGIN)** and **Adaptive Tactical Intelligence Strategy (ATIS)**—to accurately interpret tactical communication, player intent, and game-state evolution using speech data in complex sports environments.

## Abstract

Sports analytics has become central to high-performance training, yet traditional **speech recognition** systems often fall short due to noisy conditions, lack of domain adaptation, and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning-based architecture that:

- Leverages **graph neural networks** and **reinforcement learning** to model tactical and temporal dynamics.
- Integrates **game-theoretic reasoning** for strategic decision refinement.
- Supports **both audible and silent (non-verbal) command interpretation** using multimodal input.
- Utilizes **self-supervised pretraining** on diverse sports communication datasets for broader generalization.

Our evaluations show significant gains in recognition accuracy, tactical awareness, and real-time adaptability, offering a powerful tool for modern sports performance analysis.
